# Board Defence Game
- Board Defence game is simple board game in which you have to defend your base.
- To Add New Levels:
  * Go to folder Resources>LevelData
  * Create LevelData Scriptable Object
  * Set the new level values
  * You can set board dimensions, player health, enemy waves and defense items from editor.
- The State Machine Package, which I developed myself, was used in the project.
